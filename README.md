- Computing was the way that pulled my passion on,
I have also interned with Web development firm for 1 month at Octanet services tech.
This leed to my classic knowledge of building a website dynamically.
I'm a person who like inculcating the riveting things at a glance, this proved me dedicated to get more about the certain topic. 
I believe that my commitment and motivation will ensure that I will quickly become a valued member of the team..
